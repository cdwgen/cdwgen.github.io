# Interspecific Inversions

Below is the location of interspecific chromosomal inversions within the Arlee strain Coastal Rainbow Trout genome assembly ([NCBI: GCF_013265735.2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_013265735.2/); [Gao et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1093/g3journal/jkab052)), their length, and calls on which form of the inversion each taxon carries based on previous studies and/or whole genome alignments to the Atlantic Salmon reference genome ([NCBI: GCF_905237065.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_905237065.1/)). The orientations of Chr20 Inv and Chr22 Inv relative to Atlantic Salmon found here match previous observations in [Sutherland et al. 2016](https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evw262). Chromosome numbers are consistent between taxa based on [Flores et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1093/g3journal/jkaf064), so inversion names were made neutral for ease of description. Inversion forms for YCT are inferred based on observed interspecific recombination at species-diagnostic loci. For inversion form characterizations: A = ancestral; R = rearranged/derived; V = variable/not taxon-informative.

| Inversion   | Chromosome | Start (bp) | End (bp) | Length (Mb) | IRT | CRT | WCT | YCT |
|------------|------------|------------|----------|------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Chr05_Inv1 | 5          | 30,102,000 | 60,368,999 | 30.267 | R | V | A | A |
| Chr05_Inv2 | 5          | 60,369,000 | 87,502,000 | 27.133 | R | V | A | A |
| Chr13      | 13         | 25,743,000 | 28,590,000 | 2.847  | V | V | V | V |
| Chr17      | 17         | 36,050,000 | 43,906,000 | 7.856  | A | A | R | R |
| Chr20      | 20         | 4,356,000  | 21,129,000 | 16.773 | R | R | A | A |
| Chr22      | 22         | 7,308,000  | 22,170,000 | 14.862 | R | R | A | A |
| Chr29      | 29         | 2,314,000  | 14,206,000 | 11.892 | A | A | R | R |

## 3D Interactive Plots
The following interactive plots show that most interspecific inversions strongly differentiate Rainbow Trout taxa (IRT, CRT) and Cutthroat taxa. Plots are shown with the first 3 PC axes to highlight YCT ancestry on the third axis and to differentiate fish that are interspecific hybrids between RBT and WCT, RBT and YCT, or YCT and WCT.

### Chromosome 5 (Chr05) Inversion 1
This is the first of two inversions in an inversion complex first characterized in [Pearse et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-019-1044-6) on RBT chromosome 5 (Omy05). This inversion involves the centromere. IRT are fixed for the rearranged form, CRT are variable, and WCT/YCT are colinear with the RBT ancestral form.

### Chromosome 5 (Chr05) Inversion 2
The second inversion in the Chr05 complex. IRT are fixed for the rearranged form, CRT are variable, and WCT/YCT are colinear with the RBT ancestral form.

### Chromosome 13 (Chr13) Inversion
Small inversion on Chr13 that has variable orientation within populations and species groups. If real, this inversion is not species or subspecies informative.

### Chromosome 17 (Chr17) Inversion
Inversion on chromosome 17 (7.8 Mb) found by alignment of Arlee and Swanson RBT reference genomes to the Connor Lake WCT reference genome ([NCBI: 
GCF_045791955.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_045791955.1/); [Flores et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1093/g3journal/jkaf064)). Displays clear segregation between species. Recombinants between YCT and WCT are not clear but it is likely they share the same orientation. RBT carry the ancestral form; WCT and YCT are rearranged.

### Chromosome 20 (Chr20) Inversion
Large inversion on chromosome 20 that involves the centromere. RBT carry the rearranged form; WCT are ancestral. YCT are likely ancestral as well, but no recombinants were observed between the the two Cutthroat Trout taxa. 

It should be noted that chromosome 20 in WCT (Ocla20) corresponds to a fusion of RBT chromosomes 20 and 28 (Omy20; Omy28) as shown in [Flores et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1093/g3journal/jkaf064). YCT also carry this same fusion rearrangment ([Ostberg et al. 2013](https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-14-570); [Flores et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1093/g3journal/jkaf064)).

### Chromosome 22 (Chr22) Inversion
Inversion on chromosome 22 that involves the centromere. RBT carry the rearranged form; WCT and YCT are ancestral. Recombinants between WCT and YCT were observed.

### Chromosome 29 (Chr29) Inversion
This is the sex chromosome in RBT (OmyY). This inversion was described as potentially being a complex of two paracentric inversions ([Flores et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1093/g3journal/jkaf064)), but linkage mapping analyses only found support for a single inversion relative to IRT. RBT carry the ancestral form; WCT and YCT are rearranged. Recombinants between WCT and YCT were observed.
