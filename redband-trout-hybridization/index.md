# Redband Trout Hybridization Dynamics

This project explores hybridization dynamics between native Redband Trout, native Westslope Cutthroat Trout, invasive Coastal Rainbow Trout, and introduced Yellowstone Cuttroat Trout in the Kootenai River Basin in Northwest Montana using linkage maps and RAD-Capture data. 
Below are sections for project information, analyses, and interactive plots.
